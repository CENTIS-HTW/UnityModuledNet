# UnityModuledNet

## Overview

This Unity project provides a simple to use network framework for the LAN. Using its own custom protocol it allows user to send any data both reliably and unreliably. This project is designed to work both in the Unity Editor and during the Unity runtime.

## NOTICE

This is the old version of the network framework. Go to https://github.com/jKnepel/SimpleUnityNetworking for the new version!
